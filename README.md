      <p><i>Programming tutorial with extensive use of code examples, intended for developers building client applications that use the Watson Assistant REST API</i></p>
      <p>For this tutorial, I designed and wrote an example client application that was intentionally very simple, in order to keep the code examples focused on illustrating the Watson Assistant API. (I developed the example client in Python and subsequently reimplemented it in JavaScript.) The tutorial takes an iterative approach, showing multiple executable versions of the code examples as more function is added.</p>

      In the live documentation hosted on ibm.com, readers can choose to view code examples in either JavaScript (Node.js) or Python. This static version shows only the JavaScript examples.

      <p>This procedure explains how to use the Watson Assistant custom extension feature to configure an integration with a third-party service that has a REST API. The procedure describes using the Watson Assistant settings UI to complete the required steps, and is intended for advanced users who understand REST API concepts.</p>
