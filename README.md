## Overview

The following samples are excerpted from the documentation for IBM Watson Assistant as it existed on 4 May 2023. (Watson Assistant has since been rebranded as [watsonx Assistant](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-assistant).)

      <p><i>Programming tutorial with extensive use of code examples, intended for developers building client applications that use the Watson Assistant REST API</i></p>
      <p>For this tutorial, I designed and wrote an example client application that was intentionally very simple, in order to keep the code examples focused on illustrating the Watson Assistant API. (I developed the example client in Python and subsequently reimplemented it in JavaScript.) The tutorial takes an iterative approach, showing multiple executable versions of the code examples as more function is added.</p>

      In the live documentation hosted on ibm.com, readers can choose to view code examples in either JavaScript (Node.js) or Python. This static version shows only the JavaScript examples.

      <p>This procedure explains how to use the Watson Assistant custom extension feature to configure an integration with a third-party service that has a REST API. The procedure describes using the Watson Assistant settings UI to complete the required steps, and is intended for advanced users who understand REST API concepts.</p>

      <p><i>Overview of the Watson Assistant web chat feature, including both high-level conceptual information intended for all users as well as technical details for advanced users</i></p>
      <p>This conceptual overview provides an overall architectural description of the Watson Assistant web chat feature, which is a customizable widget that can be integrated with a customer website to provide a chatbot UI.</p>
      <p>This overview starts with a description of the web chat widget's behavior from an end user's perspective, using screen captures to illustrate. It then provides details about the types of chatbot responses for which the widget has out-of-the-box support.</p>
      <p>The **Technical details** section, intended for more advanced users, provides an overview of detailed information that developers or administrators might need to know. In the original live version of the documentat, this overview provided numerous links to detailed documentation elsewhere.</p>

      <p>This tutorial is intended for web developers who want to use the Watson Assistant web chat API to customize the appearance of the web chat widget in ways that go beyond the options available in the settings UI.</p>
      <p>The tutorial was developed using a collaborative process. I worked closely with a developer, who provided a fully functional code example (in an external GitHub repo) and a rough draft of the tutorial steps. I then revised the tutorial for clarity, style, and consistency. These revisions included minor edits to correct grammar or style, as well as more significant revisions (such as inserting missing steps and additional code examples for clarity).</p>
      <p>This tutorial was one of a set of similar developer tutorials that were part of a long-running project to enhance the web chat developer documentation.</p>
